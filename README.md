# Weather-Application
I’ve always been fascinated by how weather affects our daily lives. This project was a way to blend that curiosity with my growing skills in web development. It taught me how to integrate real-world data using APIs, handle user interactions, and ensure the application looks great on any device. This weather app isn’t just functional—it’s a reflection of my learning journey and passion for tech!

This weather application is designed to deliver accurate and user-friendly weather updates for any location. Built with a focus on functionality and responsiveness, it offers the following intermediate features:

📅 5-Day or Hourly Forecast: Get a quick glance at upcoming weather conditions, including temperature, wind, and precipitation, for the next five days or by the hour.

📱 Responsive Design: The app is fully mobile-friendly and adapts seamlessly across various screen sizes using responsive CSS.

📍 Geolocation Support: Automatically detects and displays weather data based on the user’s current location using browser-based geolocation.

🌡️ Temperature Unit Toggle: Users can switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit to view temperature in their preferred unit.
